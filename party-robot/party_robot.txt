In Go an application is organized in packages. A package is a collection of source files located in the same folder. 
All source files in a folder must have the same package name at the top of the file. 
By convention packages are named to be the same as the folder they are located in.

Go provides an extensive standard library of packages which you can use in your program using the import keyword. 
Standard library packages are imported using their name.

Go provides an in-built package called fmt (format package) which offers a variety of functions to manipulate the format of input and output. 
The most commonly used function is Sprintf, which uses verbs like %s to interpolate values into a string and returns that string.

In Go floating point values are conveniently formatted with Sprintf's verbs: %g (compact representation), %e (exponent) or %f (non exponent). 
All three verbs allow the field's width and numeric position to be controlled.
