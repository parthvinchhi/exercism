In Go, map is a built-in data type that maps keys to values. 

In other programming languages, you might be familiar with the concept of map as a dictionary, 
hash table, key/value store or an associative array.

Syntactically, map looks like this:
    - map[KeyType]ElementType

It is also important to know that each key is unique, 
meaning that assigning the same key twice will overwrite the value of the corresponding key.

To create a map, you can do:
    - v := map[string]int{}
    - v := make(map[string]int)

Here are some operations that you can do with a map:
    // Add a value in a map with the `=` operator:
    v["bar"] = 42
    // Here we update the element of `bar`
    v["bar"] = 73
    // To retrieve a map value, you can use
    baz := v["bar"]
    // To delete an item from a map, you can use
    delete(v, "bar")

If you try to retrieve the value for a key which does not exist in the map, it will return the zero value of the value type. 

This can confuse you, especially if the default value of your ElementType (for example, 0 for an int), is a valid value. 

To check whether a key exists in your map, you can use:
    value, exists := v["baz"]
    // If the key "baz" does not exist,
    // value: 0; exists: false
