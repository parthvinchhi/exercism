Like other languages, Go also provides a switch statement. Switch statements are a shorter way to write long "if... else if" statements.
To make a switch, we start by using the keyword switch followed by a value or expression.
We then declare each one of the conditions with the case keyword. We can also declare a default case, that will run when none of the previous
case conditions matched.

One interesting thing about switch statements, is that the value after the switch keyword can be omitted, 
and we can have boolean conditions for each case.
